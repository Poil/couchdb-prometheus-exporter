<h2 id="why-do-i-need-to-care-about-things-monitoring">Why do I need to care about things monitoring?</h2>
<p>The main propose of application metrics to answer on simple question:
"what's going on there?" Why our app works slowly? Or may be it works
fast enough? Will we face some issues in near future? Or may be we're
expecting them right now? All these questions are important if you're
going to provide high quality service and yes, wise metrics analysis
gives you ability even to predict (a little) the future!</p>
<h2 id="get-_stats-http11">GET /_stats HTTP/1.1</h2>
<p>First of all, we'll take a look on CouchDB <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/server/common.html#stats">/_stats</a> resource
which contains a lot of various CouchDB metrics: httpd request
and responses, opened databases and auth cache, continuous changes
feeds listeners and view reads, and more. These metrics are have good
self-descriptions, but let's stop on the most important ones.</p>
<h3 id="request-methods">Request Methods</h3>
<p>Every request to CouchDB starts with HTTP method which defines
operation semantic and results behavior. CouchDB operates with
the next methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HEAD</code></li>
<li><code>GET</code></li>
<li><code>POST</code></li>
<li><code>PUT</code></li>
<li><code>DELETE</code></li>
<li><code>COPY</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and tracks stats by them as well. How this information could help us?</p>
<p>As was said, request method defines operation semantic. <code>HEAD</code>
requests are used to check existence of the databases, documents
or attachments, <code>GET</code> are for fetching the data; a lot of <code>PUT</code>
requests signs about large set of update operations. On other hand
if you see a lot of <code>DELETE</code> requests this is the open room for
optimizations: mass deletes are better and effective to made via
<a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/database/bulk-api.html#db-bulk-docs">bulk update</a> requests.</p>
<p>Putting all these metrics together into single graph easily provides
the answer about how your CouchDB instance is used by your clients.</p>
<p><img alt="Request methods" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/request-methods.png"></p>
<h3 id="requests-time">Requests Time</h3>
<p>Every request is served for some amount of time. As faster it has
processed, as faster client receives the response and as more your
users are happy (as you too). Larger request times leading to "slow"
service and request timeouts, which are bad.</p>
<p>CouchDB provides <code>request_time</code> metric which represents
<em>length of a request inside CouchDB without MochiWeb</em> - not a full,
but still a picture which helps to estimate quality of service
of your CouchDB instance.</p>
<p>Suddenly, CouchDB doesn't provides per each request statistic about
spent time on it, but it provides others useful values: <code>stddev</code>
and <code>mean</code> against spent time. So we could know about average time
of our requests and a low standard deviation for them too.
The difference between them is in details: <code>stddev</code> value represents
times within +/- 1σ range (34,1% from both sides on <code>mean</code>), so it's
immune to rare, but very fast or very slow requests.</p>
<p>Looking on the next stats:</p>
<pre><code>"request_time": {
    "description": "length of a request inside CouchDB without MochiWeb",
    "current": 409002.771,
    "sum": 409002.771,
    "mean": 51.687,
    "stddev": 287.39,
    "min": 0.6666666666666667,
    "max": 5014.25
}
</code></pre>

<p>we could say, that to serve the most slow request 5 seconds was spent,
but for average request it took ~300ms to be processed by CouchDB.</p>
<p><img alt="Request times" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/request-times.png"></p>
<p>Since <code>stddev</code> and <code>mean</code> values are formed from all request that
were served, this makes them not much accurate in long term service.
To make them better, let's take a look on <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/misc.html#stats/samples">samples</a> configuration
option. You're probably wondered why it exists and on what it affects.
Well, it's allows to get the statistics for specified time frame
(in seconds). The default value is <code>[0, 60, 300, 900]</code> that means
that we could receive metrics values for all the time (<code>0</code>), for
the last minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes. In other words, we could use
that to measure <code>stddev</code> and <code>mean</code> within certain time frame without
side effect of all previous requests to get the most accurate values
which reflects the reality.</p>
<h3 id="requests-by-type">Requests by Type</h3>
<p>There are some specific requests that requires some additional
attention. CouchDB provides special <code>httpd</code> metrics group for them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HTTP requests</code>: overall amount of HTTP requests</li>
<li><code>bulk requests</code>: how often were used <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/database/bulk-api.html#db-bulk-docs">bulk updates</a></li>
<li><code>view reads</code>: amount of requests to the <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/ddoc/views.html">view indexes</a></li>
<li><code>temporary view reads</code>: amount of requests to the <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/database/temp-views.html">temporary view indexes</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Requests by type" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/http-requests.png"></p>
<p>How this information could be useful?</p>
<p>The <code>bulk update</code> operation costs single <code>POST</code> request, but it may
cause a lot of changes and significantly boost databases writes rate
(see <code>Databases I/O</code> section below).</p>
<p>The <code>temporary view reads</code> is almost always signs about executing
temporary view. That's really not good operation, especially for
huge databases for millions of documents. You'll be happy to keep
this metric around <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>view reads</code> is good metric to determine how often your views
are been used. Also, if a lot of <code>view read</code> requests comes when
view index isn't build, the resulting request time for them could be
huge.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-changes-feed-listeners">Continuous Changes Feed Listeners</h3>
<p>Another special kind of requests is subscribing to the continuous
changes feeds. Why it's so special that we're discussing it
separately? Because unlike others requests, it goes not in form
request-response, but request-response-response-response-...-response.
During this communication session the client receives all database
changes instantly.</p>
<p><img alt="Continuous changes feeds listeners" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/continuous-changes-feeds-listeners.png"></p>
<p>This metric also could be used to approximately determine amount of
pull replications which served on others instances and uses yours
as data source. But the key word is "approximately" since you
(and CouchDB too) couldn't be sure in that - these listeners could be
just a clients which monitors database changes, nothing more.</p>
<h3 id="response-status-codes">Response Status Codes</h3>
<p>Finally, when request had been served, the response returns back to
the client. With what every HTTP response starts? Right, with HTTP
status code, which defines the response nature: is it completed
successfully, or some error happened, or may be request wasn't even
correct.</p>
<p><img alt="Response status codes" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/http-status-codes.png"></p>
<p>Keeping eye on amount of HTTP <code>4xx</code> and <code>5xx</code> responses helps
you provide quality service for you users. Normally, you want to see
no <code>500</code> errors at all. Having high amount of <code>401</code> errors could say
about authentication problems while <code>403</code> tell you that something
or someone actively doing things that he's shouldn't do. Notable
amount of <code>409</code> tells about high update concurrency for some
resources.</p>
<p>Do you need to track the others codes? Yes, you do, since you'll never
know what part of successful responses errors takes.
"2 HTTP 500 errors" is about nothing, but this is bad is there are
only 10 successful responses and in the same time they could be
ignored (unless you're perfectionist) if 100000 <code>HTTP 200 OK</code>
were returned back.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-cache">Authentication Cache</h3>
<p>CouchDB keeps some amount of user credentials in memory to speedup
authentication process by elimination of additional database lookups.
This cache size is limited by the configuration option
<a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/auth.html#couch_httpd_auth/auth_cache_size">auth_cache_size</a>. On what this affects? In short, when user
login CouchDB first looks for user credentials what associated with
provided login name in auth cache and if they miss there then it reads
credentials from auth database (in other words, from disk).</p>
<p>The <code>auth_cache_miss</code> metric is highly related to <code>HTTP 401</code> responses
one, so there are three cases that are worth to be looked for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High <code>cache misses</code> and high <code>401</code> responses: something brute forces
  your server by iterating over large set of user names that doesn't
  exists for your instance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High <code>cache misses</code> and low <code>401</code> responses: your <code>auth_cache_size</code>
  is too small to handle all your active users. try to increase his
  capacity to reduce disk I/O</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low <code>cache misses</code> and high <code>401</code> responses: much likely something
  tries to brute force passwords for existed accounts on your server</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that "high" and "low" in metrics world should be read as
"anomaly high" and "anomaly low" for your instance.</p>
<p><img alt="Authentication cache ratio" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/auth-cache.png"></p>
<p>Whoa! Someone really trying to do bad things on the graph above! And that's not
looks like <code>auth_cache_size</code> issue.</p>
<p>Ok, but why do we need auth cache hit there? We need it as an ideal
value to compare misses counter with. Just for instance, is 10 cache
misses a high value? What about 100 or 1000? Having cache hits rate
at some point helps to answer on this question.</p>
<h3 id="databases-io">Databases I/O</h3>
<p>The <code>database_reads</code> and <code>database_writes</code> shows overall I/O for your
databases when documents are been read and changed. Combining both
these metrics helps to define nature of your instance: is it readonly,
mostly for reads, have balanced reads and writes, or writes-heavy.
The answer on this question helps to determine your server
optimization: for write-heavy case you need in good and fast disks,
while for read-heavy case SSD disks would be the best solution.
However, SSD always makes things better, but they lives longer when
writes are less.</p>
<p><img alt="Databases I/O" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/database-io.png"></p>
<p>You can try to get the same answer by using HTTP request methods
metrics, but the result you get wouldn't be clear: single <code>POST</code>
request for bulk update can cause a lot of writes, while same <code>POST</code>
requests against views causes only reads.</p>
<h3 id="open-databases">Open Databases</h3>
<p>CouchDB only keeps opened databases which are receives some activity:
been requested or running the compaction. The maximum amount of opened
databases in the same moment of time is limited by <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/couchdb.html#couchdb/max_dbs_open">max_dbs_open</a>
configuration option.  By default it set to <code>100</code> so you're unlikely
hit this error at startup, but it may strike later when your services
grows. When CouchDB hits this limit, any request to "closed" databases
will generate the error response: <code>{error, all_dbs_active}</code>.</p>
<p>However, once opened database doesn't remains open forever: in case of
inactivity CouchDB eventually closes them providing more space in
the room for others, but sometimes such cleanup may not help due to
large activity on your CouchDB instance, especially if it runs a lot
of replication processes.</p>
<p><img alt="Open databases" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/open-databases.png"></p>
<p>The <code>open_databases</code> metric combined with <code>max_dbs_open</code> configuration
option helps to predict and eliminate possibility of such error and
also configure your CouchDB right by your needs.</p>
<h3 id="open-files">Open Files</h3>
<p>The <code>open_files</code> metric shows amount of file descriptors that CouchDB
holds opened. Normally, CouchDB opens two file descriptors per each
database + one per view index + for compaction files + few for other
files like log file etc.</p>
<p><img alt="Open files" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/open-files.png"></p>
<p>By the way, on this graph you may see the face of the real issue: file
descriptors leak.</p>
<p>Suddenly, this metric doesn't shows real file descriptor usage, so these values
isn't accurate for <code>emfile</code> error prediction (but for approximately it's ok).
See below for the fix.</p>
<h2 id="cool-but-can-i-do-more">Cool! But can I do more?</h2>
<p>Yes! But since this moment we need to elevate our privileged up to
CouchDB server administrator. This opens us more doors and stats
sources.</p>
<h3 id="active-tasks">Active Tasks</h3>
<p>One day you're looking though graphics of your monitoring system
and see that your CouchDB server suffers from heavy disk I/O.
Really heavy disk I/O. What could cause that? You take a look on
<code>Databases I/O</code> graph, but nothing seems wrong there. Another look
on the requests graphs - again, there are not much as usual write
requests made, bulk updates are also on the normal level.
But diskstats is full of not peaks, but really high "mountains".
So what's going wrong there?</p>
<p>Before completely exclude CouchDB from list of causers, we need to
check the <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/server/common.html#active-tasks">/_active_tasks</a> resource. The database compaction is
an operation with heavy I/O (since it's about copying a lot of data
from database <code>A</code> to database <code>B</code>) and if there runs multiple of them
for the large databases this could explain the situation.
Views indexing also matters, but not so much as compactions are.</p>
<p><img alt="Active tasks" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/active-tasks.png"></p>
<p>Allowing your monitoring tools to track active tasks on your CouchDB
instance helps to detect these operations: when they starts and when
they ends and with help of others metrics make a diagnostic of current
disk I/O issues.</p>
<p>As bonus, active tasks also shows amount of active replication served
by this instance. This could be useful for you.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-server-admins">Know Your Server Admins</h3>
<p>CouchDB server administrators are the gods and can do a lot of things,
especially dangerous and which requires care and attention. Normally,
you have set up some certain amount of server admins users: for
yourself and for people you trusted to administrate your instance, but
are you sure that their amount wouldn't be changed in time?</p>
<p>With simple monitoring of server admins amount (keys length of object
from <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/auth.html#admins">/_config/admins</a> response) you'll be notified in case when
new server administrators were added and if you still don't know
"who? and why?" it's good time to find the answers on these questions.
For the security reasons.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-users">Know Your Users</h3>
<p>Ok, you provides some public service based on CouchDB, let's say
it's blogging platform. Users comes, registers, generates content,
service lives active life. But how many users you have? How faster
your user database grows? Or may be it's stalled? These questions
are also important. Bigger users database requires to have bigger
resources to provide for your service and reserve for future.</p>
<p>The answer on these questions is pretty simple: you need to monitor
<a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/intro/security.html#authentication-database">authentication database</a> documents count. By requesting
<a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/database/common.html#get--db">database information</a> you'll know two things about your users:
how much registered you have and how many of them were deleted.</p>
<p><img alt="CouchDB users" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/users.png"></p>
<p>This graph shows us that nothing had changed in observed time frame, it's a pity.</p>
<p>This would say nothing about how many users are really active, nothing
about how much of them working with your service in the same time -
CouchDB doesn't knows that, but tracing the change of documents count
answers helps to understand growing potential of your users database.
That's really important for planning and marketing things.</p>
<p>As about users activity, just place near graphic with request methods
and apply some base mathematics magic to estimate average activity.</p>
<h2 id="and-now-that-all">And now that all?</h2>
<p>Not yet. On monitoring the authentication database we used information
about documents count and how faster their number grows. Why not to
apply same questions for others databases?</p>
<h3 id="graveyard-databases">Graveyard Databases</h3>
<p>You should know, that when you deletes a document from database it's
actually doesn't physically removed from database. If you'd used
<code>DELETE</code> method, then CouchDB removes all document fields (except
system <code>_id</code> and <code>_rev</code>) and adds another new special one:
<code>_deleted: true</code>. You can also mark document as deleted by just simple
update via <code>PUT</code> request by adding same <code>_deleted: true</code> field to it
without removing any others fields - document will be "deleted", but
all his content remains preserved.</p>
<p>This behavior leads to the situations when long lived databases
contains a lot of deleted documents which are consumes significant
amount of disk space. The <em>Graveyard Database</em> is the database which
have deleted documents more than existed ("alive") ones.</p>
<p><img alt="Database documents" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/database-docs.png"></p>
<p>The reason to track such databases is the disk space. At some moment
you'll want to completely remove deleted documents from these
databases. That's easily to do via filtered replication.
However, make sure that there is no any active replication that uses
these databases as target otherwise all deleted documents would be
replicated back again.</p>
<h3 id="database-fragmentation">Database Fragmentation</h3>
<p>Another bit of your knowledge about CouchDB reminds you that databases
have to be compacted from time to time to free disk space which is
consumed by old documents revisions.</p>
<p>But when to run database compaction? And, since this is heavy disk I/O
operation, when it's reasonable to compact database?</p>
<p>Great questions. And again monitoring of database size helps to answer
on them.</p>
<p><img alt="Database disk usage" src="./guide-to-couchdb-monitoring_files/database-frag.png"></p>
<p>This database looks as a good candidate to be compacted RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/json-structure.html#couchdb-database-information-object">database information object</a> contains two fields that are
relevant to this problem: <code>disk_size</code> and <code>data_size</code>. <code>data_size</code>
is the actual size of stored data, <code>disk_size</code> is the actual on disk
size of database. Difference between these values shows the stored
overhead which could be eliminated via database compaction.</p>
<p>At what point it's reasonable to start a database compaction? Well,
the answer on that question depends on total amount of available disk
space on partition where databases are stored. Personally, I prefer
mark 50% for overhead of <code>disk_size</code> over <code>data_size</code>, but it's all
depends from your environment and resources that you have.</p>
<h3 id="views-fragmentation">Views Fragmentation</h3>
<p>As well as databases, view indexes are also needs to be compacted.
The strategy for them is the same, except that single database can
contains dozens design documents.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-of-couchdb-api">Beyond of CouchDB API</h2>
<p>Our monitoring powers could be extended if we have access to
environment of the host which serves CouchDB instance. This gives us
more important information about CouchDB.</p>
<p>Note, I wouldn't tell there about disk space issues: that's quite
trivial case and it handles by every monitoring tools by default.</p>
<h3 id="file-descriptors">File Descriptors</h3>
<p>Does the error: <code>{error, emfile}</code> looks familiar for you? Right, it's
about exhausting of available file descriptors for CouchDB user.
This error always happens SUDDENLY and leads to deny of service.
That's completely bad, but this situation you can predict and fix long
before it'll happens by using monitoring tools.</p>
<h3 id="os-daemons">OS Daemons</h3>
<p>CouchDB has awesome feature called <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/externals.html#how-does-it-work-os-daemons">os_daemons</a> - it turns CouchDB
into supervisor for thirdparty scripts or applications which are
served by CouchDB, respawned on failure and able to communicate with
CouchDB thought simple JSON-over-stdio protocol.</p>
<p>While that's feature is awesome, CouchDB doesn't shows <code>os_daemons</code>
status in the list of active tasks, so you don't know are they alive
or actually dead (CouchDB stops his attempts to respawn process after
5 continuous failures). But we can fix that with monitoring tools.</p>
<p>The strategy is quite trivial: get the list of <code>os_daemons</code> from
configuration and iterate over CouchDB child processes. If process
exists - it's alive. Those who wasn't found marks as dead.</p>
<h2 id="resume">Resume</h2>
<p>Metrics are import part of any system since they can tell you what's
going on, what's going wrong and even what's will be wrong in nearest
future.</p>
<p>Please note, that all these graphs are good to visualise processes
that goes on server, they are miss concrete details about situation.
If you have powerful system to manage application logs with flexible
searching both solutions might be awesome additional to each over.</p>
<h2 id="awesome-can-i-haz-all-these-now">Awesome! Can I haz all these NOW?</h2>
<p>The most of monitoring systems plugins for CouchDB are unable
to handle all the described cases since they are trying to work with
just <code>/_stats</code> resource - it's good, but, as you may noted,
not enough to see full picture of your CouchDB.</p>
<p>However, at least for Munin there is one that's going to handle all
this post recommendations. This plugin had been initially written by
